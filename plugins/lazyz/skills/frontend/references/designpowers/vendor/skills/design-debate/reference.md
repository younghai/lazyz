# Design Debate

Good design decisions come from tension, not consensus. When agents converge too quickly, they optimise for agreement instead of the best answer. This skill creates productive conflict — agents argue for competing directions with real trade-offs, and the user decides.

## When to Use

- When the design-strategist identifies multiple viable directions
- When the design-lead proposes a visual direction and alternatives exist
- When the user says "I'm not sure which way to go" or "what are my options?"
- When the design-critic recommends "rethink" — a debate can surface the better path
- When a decision has significant downstream consequences (navigation pattern, layout model, interaction paradigm)
- When the user explicitly asks for a debate: "debate this", "argue both sides", "what are the trade-offs?"

## Do Not Use When

- The decision is trivial (icon choice, exact padding value)
- Accessibility requirements dictate the answer — there is nothing to debate
- The user has already made up their mind — respect their direction
- The brief clearly specifies the approach — follow it

## Process

### Step 1: Frame the Question

Define the design question precisely. A debate without a clear question produces noise.

Format:
```
DESIGN QUESTION: [Specific, answerable question]
CONTEXT: [Brief context from design-state.md]
CONSTRAINTS: [Non-negotiable requirements from brief, accessibility, taste profile]
STAKES: [Why this decision matters — what it affects downstream]
```

**Example:**
```
DESIGN QUESTION: Should the onboarding flow use a multi-step wizard or a single scrollable page?
CONTEXT: App for first-time pet owners, ages 25-45. Primary persona has mild anxiety about "doing it right."
CONSTRAINTS: Must be completable in under 3 minutes. Must work on mobile. Must not require account creation upfront.
STAKES: Sets the interaction pattern for all future multi-step flows in the app.
```

### Step 2: Assign Advocates

Select 2-3 agents to argue for different directions. Each agent argues FOR their assigned position — they are advocates, not neutral analysts.

| Role | What They Argue |
|------|----------------|
| **Advocate A** | The case for Direction A — strengths, evidence, personas it serves best |
| **Advocate B** | The case for Direction B — strengths, evidence, personas it serves best |
| **Advocate C** (optional) | A third direction, a hybrid, or a "neither — here's why" position |

Assign agents based on their expertise:

| Agent | Best suited to advocate for |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **design-strategist** | UX patterns, information architecture, user flow approaches |
| **design-lead** | Visual directions, layout models, component architecture |
| **content-writer** | Content strategy approaches, tone directions, naming conventions |
| **motion-designer** | Interaction paradigms, feedback models, transition approaches |
| **accessibility-reviewer** | The most inclusive option, cognitive load implications |
| **design-scout** | Evidence-backed positions from competitive research |

### Step 3: Run the Debate

Each advocate delivers their argument in this format:

```markdown
## [Agent Name] argues for: [Direction]

### The Case
[2-3 paragraphs making the strongest possible argument for this direction.
Be specific — reference the brief, personas, principles, and evidence.]

### Who This Serves Best
[Which personas benefit most and why]

### Who This Serves Least
[Which personas might struggle and why — be honest]

### Trade-Offs
[What you give up by choosing this direction]

### Evidence
[Research, patterns, competitive examples, or design principles that support this]
```

Rules for advocates:
1. **Argue to win** — make the strongest case you can. Do not hedge
2. **Be honest about weaknesses** — a strong argument acknowledges its trade-offs
3. **Reference the brief** — ground arguments in the project's actual goals
4. **Reference personas** — every argument must address who it helps and who it doesn't
5. **No straw men** — do not weaken the opposing position to make yours look better

### Step 4: Cross-Examination

After all advocates present, each gets one round of rebuttal:

```markdown
### [Agent Name] responds to [Other Agent]:
[1-2 paragraphs directly addressing the strongest point of the opposing argument.
Concede what is true. Challenge what is weak.]
```

This prevents echo-chamber advocacy — each agent must engage with the other side's best arguments.

### Step 5: Accessibility Check

Before presenting to the user, the **accessibility-reviewer** evaluates all proposed directions:

```markdown
## Accessibility Assessment

| Direction | Accessibility Impact | Concern Level |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Direction A | [Assessment] | Low / Medium / High |
| Direction B | [Assessment] | Low / Medium / High |

[If any direction creates accessibility barriers, flag it clearly.
This is not an argument for a direction — it is a constraint check.]
```

If a direction has High accessibility concern, it should be flagged prominently in the presentation to the user. The user can still choose it, but they should know the cost.

### Step 6: Present to User

Show the debate to the user in a structured format:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  DESIGN DEBATE
  Question: [The design question]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  DIRECTION A: [Name]
  Argued by: [agent]
  [2-3 sentence summary of the case]
  Best for: [personas]
  Trade-off: [key trade-off]

  DIRECTION B: [Name]
  Argued by: [agent]
  [2-3 sentence summary of the case]
  Best for: [personas]
  Trade-off: [key trade-off]

  [DIRECTION C if applicable]

  ACCESSIBILITY: [One-line summary of any concerns]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  YOUR CALL: Which direction do you want to take?
  (You can also ask for more detail on any direction,
   or propose a hybrid.)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 7: Record the Decision

After the user decides:

1. Record the chosen direction in `design-state.md` Decisions Log with rationale
2. Record the rejected directions and why — this is valuable context for future debates
3. If the decision reveals a taste preference, update `design-memory`
4. Dispatch the appropriate agent to execute the chosen direction

## Debate Depth

Not every debate needs the full process. Scale the depth to the stakes:

| Stakes | Debate Format |
|--------|--------------|
| **High** (sets architectural pattern) | Full debate: 2-3 advocates, cross-examination, accessibility review |
| **Medium** (affects multiple screens) | Quick debate: 2 advocates, no cross-examination, accessibility flag |
| **Low** (affects one component) | Micro debate: 2 options presented as a simple comparison table, user picks |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `design-strategy`, `using-designpowers` (when user requests debate), `designpowers-critique` (when "rethink" is recommended)
- **Calls:** Any agent as advocate, `accessibility-reviewer` for constraint check
- **Updates:** `design-state` with decision and rejected alternatives
- **Informs:** `design-memory` with taste signals from the user's choice
- **Pairs with:** `design-strategy`, `design-memory`, `taste-feedback`

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| Debating after the user has decided | Wastes time. If the user has a direction, execute it |
| Debating trivial decisions | 8px vs 12px padding is not a debate — it's a design system decision |
| Agents being polite instead of advocating | "Both options are great!" is not a debate. Agents must argue to win |
| Presenting a debate without accessibility review | Every direction must be evaluated for inclusion before the user chooses |
| Running a debate in auto mode without pausing | Debates ALWAYS pause for user decision — they are inherently direct-mode moments |
| More than 3 directions | Too many options cause decision paralysis. If there are more than 3, narrow down first |
